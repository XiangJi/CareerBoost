# CareerBoost
Practice DSA (This is actually the best practice for a interview question), test plan (system test, integration test, unit test, write a simple test framework) design, system design (load balancer, firewall) and OOP problems

1. DSA
   Question Types and frequency
    DP: 1d, 2d correctness arguements. greedy
    Graph
    Segment tree, trie
    OS, recursion

 Tips:
 Clarification questions a lot! Could this? Could that? (Does data fit memory or hard drive, scalability questions, multiple server)
 Think aloud! Interact with interviewers.
 Talk before write.
 How would you unit test your code, come up with a test case and edge case. Run a test case loudly.
 End to end, integration, load and performance, security tests
 Know the time and space complexity
