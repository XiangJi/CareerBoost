# Height-Balanced BST

## Concepts

A height-balanced BST is a special form of BST which aims at improving the performance. The details of implementations are outside the scope of this article series and are not required in most interviews. But it is useful to understand the general idea of a height-balanced BST and how height-balanced BSTs can help you in your algorithm designs.

The height-balanced BST is widely used in practice since it can provide search, insertion and deletion operations all in `O(logN)` time complexity.

Typically, the height-balanced BST will be used here to improve the performance from `O(N)` to `O(logN)`.
