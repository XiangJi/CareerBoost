/*
 * There is a garden with N slots. In each slot, there is a flower. The N flowers will bloom one by one in N days. In each day, there will be exactly one flower blooming and it will be in the status of blooming since then.

Given an array flowers consists of number from 1 to N. Each number in the array represents the place where the flower will open in that day.

For example, flowers[i] = x means that the unique flower that blooms at day i will be at position x, where i and x will be in the range from 1 to N.

Also given an integer k, you need to output in which day there exists two flowers in the status of blooming, and also the number of flowers between them is k and these flowers are not blooming.

If there isn't such day, output -1.

Example 1:
Input: 
flowers: [1,3,2]
k: 1
Output: 2
Explanation: In the second day, the first and the third flower have become blooming.
Example 2:
Input: 
flowers: [1,2,3]
k: 1
Output: -1
Note:
The given array will be in the range [1, 20000].

Let's add flowers in the order they bloom. When each flower blooms, we check it's neighbors to see if they can satisfy the condition with the current flower.
