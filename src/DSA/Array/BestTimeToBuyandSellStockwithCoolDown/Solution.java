/*
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
Example:

Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]

To represent the decision at index i:

buy[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is ending with a buy.
sell[i]: Max profit till index i. The series of transaction is ending with a sell.
To clarify:

Till index i, the buy / sell action must happen and must be the last action. It may not happen at index i. It may happen at i - 1, i - 2, ... 0.
In the end n - 1, return sell[n - 1]. Apparently we cannot finally end up with a buy. In that case, we would rather take a rest at n - 1.
For special case no transaction at all, classify it as sell[i], so that in the end, we can still return sell[n - 1].

buy[i]表示在第i天之前最后一个操作是买，此时的最大收益。

sell[i]表示在第i天之前最后一个操作是卖，此时的最大收益。

rest[i]表示在第i天之前最后一个操作是冷冻期，此时的最大收益。

我们写出递推式为：

buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1] - price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1])
rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])

上述递推式很好的表示了在买之前有冷冻期，买之前要卖掉之前的股票。一个小技巧是如何保证[buy, rest, buy]的情况不会出现，这是由于buy[i] <= rest[i]， 即rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], rest[i-1])，这保证了[buy, rest, buy]不会出现。

另外，由于冷冻期的存在，我们可以得出rest[i] = sell[i-1]，这样，我们可以将上面三个递推式精简到两个：

buy[i]  = max(sell[i-2] - price, buy[i-1])
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1])
