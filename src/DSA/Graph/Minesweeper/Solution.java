/*
 * This is a typical Search problem, either by using DFS or BFS. Search rules:

If click on a mine ('M'), mark it as 'X', stop further search.
If click on an empty cell ('E'), depends on how many surrounding mine:
2.1 Has surrounding mine(s), mark it with number of surrounding mine(s), stop further search.
2.2 No surrounding mine, mark it as 'B', continue search its 8 neighbors.

You are given a 2D char matrix representing the game board. 'M' represents an unrevealed mine, 'E' represents an unrevealed empty square, 'B' represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent (above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals) mines, digit ('1' to '8') represents how many mines are adjacent to this revealed square, and finally 'X' represents a revealed mine.
